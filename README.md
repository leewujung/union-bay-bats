# Union Bay Bat Monitoring

## Goals
The overarching goal of this project is to build the Union Bay Natural Area into a natural observatory for studying echolocating bats.

We are currently in the pilot phase of the project, with the following short-term goals:
- collect pilot acoustic data using low-cost ultrasonic recorders (AudioMoths)
- summarize the occurrence of bat calls throughout summer to fall
- based on bat occurrence, try trapping bats to identify species
